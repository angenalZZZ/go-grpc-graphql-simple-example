# Go + gRPC + GraphQL

This repo uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for vendoring. Make sure you got it installed. You can
get started by running `go install ./...`. Then in one terminal, run `hellosrv`.
In the other, run `gqlapi`. Go to your browser at http://localhost:8080 and
knock yourself out.
